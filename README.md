Lazy Work Time Tracker for Android
==================================

I have a hard time trying to remember to register my work punch card.

So I've created this App to help me, it will monitor configured
wifi networks and will create entry logs when I connect/disconnect to 
selected networks, showing a notification, or playing a sound when
such event happens. It will also generate and export reports.
